This program is using a micro-framework : 

- functions.php contains nice functions you  could use

- index.php is a catch-all php, that catches the /controller/action urls as follow : 

In controller/ folder, create one class for each first-level directory in your website : 

for http://example.com/something/ 
create somethingController.php which will contain the declaration of somethingController class.

then create the method 
function indexAction() { }
that will be called for http://example.com/something/ 

and any other method will be called as follow : 
function anotherAction() { }
will be called for http://example.com/something/another (with or without trailing /)

Those methods should either call 
      redirect($url) to redirect to another url
or
      render($view) to render a view in view/ folder.
If any error occured, call
   not_found() 
to send the usual 404 error message ... 


GLOBALS : 

* any trailing /data/id/123... after /class/action will be filled in $params[] as a numeric array of data (splited at /)
* $view should be filled with any data useful for the view...

any file in static/ will be send as-is to the user
